============
INTRODUCTION
============

Bluebottle is a GPU-centric finite-difference incompressible Navier-Stokes flow
solver coupled with the Physalis method for fully resolving spherical particles
dispersed throughout the flow. It is a research code being developed by Adam
Sierakowski (sierakowski@jhu.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Andrea
Prosperetti at the Johns Hopkins University.

Bluebottle is capable of simulating particle-laden fluid flows in configurations
ranging from particles in Stokes flow to flows at moderate Reynolds number.
Since particles are fully resolved within the flow solver, Bluebottle accurately
captures the physical behavior of these fluid flows at arbitrary particle volume
fraction. Bluebottle has been used to investigate particle behavior in channel
flows, shear flows, sedimentation, and other canonical situations with up to
8,000 particles in domains consisting of over 30-million degrees of freedom on a
single GPU.

Constructed with the primary goal of bringing to bear the power inherent in
today's GPU hardware on particle flow physics simulations, Bluebottle has been
shown to operate up to 100 times faster than a legacy CPU implementation.
