this version of code can:

1, do pope's forcing in low wvenumber shell
2, also subtract the forcing the particle feels due to the random forcing(add the vol*forcing in particle center)
3, output the random forcing and the hydrodynamic force 
4, pass seeder value from command line
5, generate seeder in a sequence and read the value automatically
